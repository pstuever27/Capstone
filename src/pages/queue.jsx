// File: queue.jsx (derived from App.jsx)
// Description: This react component provides queue logic. 
// Programmer(s): Nicholas Nguyen
// Created on: 01/19/2024
//
// Revised on: 02/09/2024
// Revision: Nicholas changed the way song titles were being displayed in the queue
//            also added color palette context to change the color of the dequeue button
// Revised on: 04/15/2024
// Revision: Kieran added an 'x' button to the end of each song rendered in the queue which removes that track from the queue when clicked
//            also removed the dequeue button as we don't need it now, and made is so if they queue is empty it prints a little grey message letting the user know
// Revised on: 04/19/2024
// Revision: Kieran added a play next up arrow button that moves the song to the top of the queue
//
// Preconditions: Must have npm and node installed to run in dev environment.
